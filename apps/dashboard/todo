General:
- When loading the app, isAuthenticated is always false initially / the user gets redirected to /auth/login in the authguard, even if the auth check succeeds --> try something with location: from
-  try setting auth route prefix to empty string, this should work since dashboard routes match first; however this may be problematic with a wildcard route
- generic fetch thing: be sure that no runtime errors occur and maybe construct url path safely with respect to slashes etc
- What to do in staff details if query fails because staff with that id doesn't exist?
- actual problem is redirecting to /auth/login (and then back to /dashboard/staff): if only checking for isAuthenticated, this will be initially false, but why the hack is this even called when having check on loading even before? Also, change to tanstack query 
- add check auth endpoint
- use react query in auth context
- in staff details: How to add a check if any errors are present, when the user wants to navigate away. In specific: If the user sets the name of a staff member to "" and, without blurring, wants to navigate to e.g. services, how to stop navigation, stay on the page and make error visible?
- do i need mutation keys?
- examine: is it problematic that body in post is optional but nevertheless added to fetch?
- rename StaffDetails to StaffPage or so
- with checkboxes in services or working times: Should they have a separate state that reflects immediate state updates? When clicking a checkbox really fast, how to ensure that the ultimate 'selected' is propagated to handlers? Does onMutate ensure that any changes are already made for any subsequent changes, e.g. in selected state, that is derived from props?
- unify delay of debounced mutate functions
- maybe it would be beneficial to have start and end time of working time already as Dayjs in the type --> use mapper to map appropriately 
- src/app folder contents must be put somewhere else
- use a snackbar to display errors; e.g. errors for changing/toggling working times currently aren't handled at all
- rename staff details > details to something else, like "General" or "information"
- display an error fallback if isError is true and if no cached data is available (like when launching the app). But when some cached, old data is there, this data should be displayed plus there should be a snackbar/toast notification that data could not be refreshed
- unify mutations: some have useDebouncedCallback outside, others inside



Current branch:
- error message in staffName is wrong
- onError optimistic update for working times is missing
