# Studiobooker

This is a studiobooker hobby project and consists of two apps.

## Dashboard

A dashboard to manage a company (like some hair/nail/massage studio) with staff, offered services and a calendar to organize appointments.

## Public webpage

A public web page where customers can book appointments for some studio. There is also some placeholder for searching studios, but that is not implemented yet.

## Backend

There also is a [full backend](https://github.com/blimmbamm/studiobooker-backend) built with Nest.
